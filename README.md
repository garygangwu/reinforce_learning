### 1. Frozen Lake
Successfully solved 8X8 [Frozen Lake](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) in slippery mode. The task involves guiding the character from the top-left starting position to the bottom-right goal without falling into any holes. Due to the slippery ice, thereâ€™s only a 1/3 chance of moving in the intended direction, with a 2/3 chance of sliding in one of the perpendicular directions.
